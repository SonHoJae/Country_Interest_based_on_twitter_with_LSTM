"# Country_Interest_based_on_twitter_with_LSTM"

* Issues
1. Twitter doesn't allow me to run more than two process with given api-key
2. For Urdu, hindi, People sometimes use their language in english as it sounds out. Google translator is able to
detect these languages written in english however it doesn't seem to be perfect
3. If program can't catch up real time data, twitter streaming api raise an error -> You might need to push date to
other remote system and let them take cake of it
4. Google translator can't handle emoji. You might need to consider UNICODE Table of all the emoji
